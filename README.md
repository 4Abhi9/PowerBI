# PowerBI
<a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview'><b>PowerBI</b></a> is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

In Simple Words, <h2>Bridge the gap between data and decision making </h2>

There are 3 versions of Power BI. <b> Free, Pro, and Premium.</b>

The free version is really only for personal use. Itâ€™s target customer would be someone who wants to create charts and graphs for their own personal consumption.
